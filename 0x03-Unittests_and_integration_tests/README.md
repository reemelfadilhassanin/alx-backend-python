# Unit Tests and Integration Tests Project

This project focuses on implementing unit and integration tests for a backend application. It aims to reinforce the understanding of testing patterns, including mocking and parameterization.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- To differentiate between unit tests and integration tests.
- To implement unit tests for specific functions using the `unittest` framework.
- To practice using parameterized tests for more efficient test case management.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- `unittest` library (included in Python standard library)
- `parameterized` library (install via pip)

To install the parameterized library, run:
```bash
pip install parameterized
