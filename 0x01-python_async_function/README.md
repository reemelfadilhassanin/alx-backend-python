# Python Async Project

This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` module. It includes the implementation of a coroutine that waits for a random delay.

## Project Structure


### Files

- `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Contains the implementation of the `wait_random` coroutine.
- `0-main.py`: A test script to demonstrate the functionality of the `wait_random` coroutine.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

### General Requirements

- All files must be executable.
- All Python files should start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Code should conform to `pycodestyle` version 2.5.x.
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- Each module and function should have proper documentation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- The `async` and `await` syntax.
- How to execute an async program using `asyncio`.
- How to run concurrent coroutines.
- How to create asyncio tasks.
- How to use the random module.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alx-backend-python.git
   cd alx-backend-python/0x01-python_async_function
